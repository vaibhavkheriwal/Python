"""
Write a Python function to find the longest substring of a given string that contains exactly k distinct characters. If there are multiple substrings with the same length, return the first one that appears. Assume the input string contains only lowercase alphabets. 

input_string = "eceba"
k = 2
Expected output: "ece"

For input_string = "eceba" and k = 2, the longest substring with exactly 2 distinct characters is "ece".
